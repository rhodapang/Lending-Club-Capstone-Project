# Predicting Default Rate for Lending Club Dataset

[LendingClub](https://www.lendingclub.com/) is a US peer-to-peer lending company and the world's largest peer-to-peer lending platform. The purpose of this data science project is to come up with a delinquency prediction model for the Lending Club. These models could help LendingClub investors make better-informed investment decisions.

In this project, I build machine learning models to predict the probability that a loan on LendingClub will charge off (default).  I use a 1.8 GB LendingClub dataset with 1,646,801 loans and 150 variables for each loan.
